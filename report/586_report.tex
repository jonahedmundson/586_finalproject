\section{Introduction}

The dataset constructed for this analysis was obtained from Facebook. Facebook profile IDs were scraped from new members of 2 Facebook ``Groups'': republicans from \href{https://www.facebook.com/groups/RU4TX/}{Republicans in Texas}, and democrats from \href{https://www.facebook.com/groups/111188856119651/}{Democratic Voices for Biden/Harris 2024}. The python API wrapper \href{https://github.com/kevinzg/facebook-scraper}{\texttt{facebook-scraper}} was used to obtain URLs to each user's profile picture. Then, profile pictures were scanned for faces and cropped to a common size of 120 x 120 pixels using the Haar Cascades facial detection algorithm. 


Finally, faces were assigned X facial attributes using Y.





Assumptions of the following analysis due to the method of dataset construction are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item ``Democrats'' and ``republicans'' are good proxies for ``liberal'' and ``conservative'', respectively. 
\item Democrats/republicans on Facebook are representative of democrats and republicans in general. 
\item Users that set profiles pictures of themselves versus of a non-face picture do not have different facial attributes. 
\end{itemize}
